# :robot: Jean, the Art Bot

Code for Jean, the agorithmic art bot. Jean uses Unsplash images and some random algorithms to transform them into unqiue interpretations.

Currently, Jean needs me to run them in order to post. :slightly_frowning_face: 
(I know, one of the few downsides of Replit).

Jean will recieve an update in the future to let them be independent.
